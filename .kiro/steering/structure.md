## File Organization Guidelines
- Keep related files grouped in logical directories
- Use clear, descriptive file and folder names
- Separate source code from configuration and documentation
- Maintain consistent naming conventions throughout the project
- Place utility scripts in a dedicated scripts directory

## Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose
- Group related functionality in appropriately named modules
